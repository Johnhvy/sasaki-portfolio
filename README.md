Built by <a href="">@ササキ　アツシ</a> for his own portfolio. ****. You are allowed to use this webpage for both personal and commercial use, but **NOT** to claim it as your own design. **A credit to the original author, Boris Edison, is a must!**

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
